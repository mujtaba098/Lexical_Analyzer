# Lexical_Analyzer
A Compiler converts high level languages to machine language. Several phases are involved in this process and lexical analysis is the first phase.
The above code is a sample algorithm which illustrates the process.

After lexical analysis, a symbol table is generated;

Token   Type
c	      identifier
=	      operator
a	      identifier
+	      operator
b	      identifier
;	      separator
